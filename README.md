# StaticSiteGenerator

This is a Static Site Generator and markdown to html converter. 
So far it accepts different kinds of formating (* for italic is not accepted currently, only _. Might add support for that later on)
I might try to build on this project in the future.
The content of the generated website (and the Project itself) stems for the StaticSiteGenerator guided project, as seen on the bottom of the generated website.
